# Pear — AI Assistant Guide

## What This App Is

Pear (package `pear`, slug `wingmate`) is an iOS dating app. Two roles:

- **Dater** — browses profiles, swipes, chats with matches.
- **Winger** — a trusted friend who swipes on behalf of a dater.

Core flows: Auth → Onboarding → Discover → Matches → Messaging → Wingpeople.

## Directory Structure

The repo is a monorepo with a root `Justfile`. Three workspaces:

- **`app/`** — the bare React Native app (this is where the mobile project lives; cwd for all `npm`/`expo` CLI commands — `expo` stays only as a JS-side CLI, not the native runtime).
- **`backend/`** — the Litestar (Python) API + worker.
- **`infra/`** — Terraform for the single-EC2 deploy.

## Existing API Domains

All endpoints live under `backend/app/domain/<feature>/` (Litestar). Mounted under
`/api` in `backend/app/factory.py`; `/auth/*` and `/ws` stay at the root.

| Domain            | Owns                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `contacts`        | Wingperson relationships (invite, accept, remove) |
| `decisions`       | Swipe likes/passes and winger suggestions         |
| `discover`        | Dater swipe feed + winger pool                    |
| `likes_you`       | Who liked the current dater                       |
| `matches`         | Mutual match list + detail                        |
| `messages`        | Chat message list + send                          |
| `photos`          | Photo upload, approval, delete                    |
| `profiles`        | Own profile read + edit                           |
| `prompts`         | Prompt templates, dater prompts, responses        |
| `wing_pool`       | Pool of profiles for a winger to swipe            |
| `winger_activity` | Feed of winger actions for the dater              |
| `winger_tabs`     | Winger-tab navigation data                        |
| `reports`         | Report/block a profile                            |

Cross-cutting platform code (auth, actions framework, state machine, RLS, queue,
media, realtime) lives under `backend/app/platform/`, not in a domain.

## How to Add a New Feature

The backend is **Litestar** with a read/write split: **reads** are GET routes
(Orval-generated hooks), **writes** are registered **actions** gated by a state
machine. A new domain lives under `backend/app/domain/<feature>/`:

1. **Model + enums** — SQLAlchemy model in `models.py`, `TextEnum` (StrEnum) members in
   `enums.py`. Then `just db-migrate "<message>"` (Alembic autogenerate). If the table
   needs RLS, reach for the reusable mixins in `rls_mixins.py` first: subclass
   `UserScopedMixin` (owner-only access; override the owner column with
   `class T(BaseDBModel, UserScopedMixin, user_id_column="...")`) for plain user-scoped
   tables, or `WingpersonScopedMixin` (owner OR active wingperson; `owner_column="..."`)
   for tables a dater and their active winger both touch. The mixin registers its
   `is_system_mode()`-escaped policy automatically — no `rls_policies.py` entry needed.
   Only hand-write a bespoke policy in `rls_policies.py` when the access shape genuinely
   diverges (public select, relational EXISTS joins, suggester/approval rules, etc.).
   Either way the table is enabled + FORCE RLS and the `pear_app` grants come
   automatically. `just db-upgrade` to apply locally.
2. **`schemas.py`** — `msgspec.Struct` request/response shapes. Derive literals from the
   domain enums.
3. **`routes.py`** — reads only. Use `CRUDConfig`/`make_crud_controller` for standard
   list/detail, or explicit `@get` handlers for bespoke shapes. Build a `<feature>_router`.
4. **`actions.py`** — all writes. Define an action group via `action_group_factory(...)`,
   then `@<feature>_actions` each `BaseTopLevelAction` / `BaseObjectAction`. Gate every
   state-changing action: implement `is_available` (narrow to the valid current state)
   and set `target_state` — go **through the state machine**
   (`deps.state_machine_service.transition(...)`); **never assign the status column
   directly**. The `discover_and_import(["actions.py", ...])` boot scan registers them.
5. **Register** the `<feature>_router` in the `/api` parent `Router` in
   `backend/app/factory.py`, and add the group's `ActionGroupType` member in
   `backend/app/platform/actions/enums.py`.
6. **Export OpenAPI + codegen the client:** regenerate `app/openapi.json` from the
   Litestar app, then `cd app && npm run api:gen` (Orval) to refresh
   `app/lib/api/generated/`.
7. **Screen reads** — import the generated hook `useGetApi<Feature>Suspense()` from
   `@/lib/api/generated/<tag>/<tag>.ts`. Destructure `data` directly.
8. **Screen writes** — call the typed action client in `app/lib/api/actions.ts`
   (`POST /api/actions/{group}[/{object_id}]`). Wire with `useMutation` +
   `invalidateQueries`.
9. **Tests** — add `backend/tests/test_<feature>.py` (pytest; `just test`).
10. **Commit** the generated artifacts (`app/openapi.json`, `app/lib/api/generated/`) in
    the same commit as the source that produced them.

**RLS note.** The app connects to Postgres as the **non-superuser `pear_app`** role, so
`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is the real authorization floor (no owner/superuser bypass).
The honored escape for trusted bootstrap/worker code is the `public.is_system_mode()`
GUC (`SET LOCAL app.is_system_mode = true`), **not** a privileged connection. Per-request
the actor is set via `SET LOCAL app.user_id`. Never assign state columns directly —
mutations flow through actions + the state machine.

**System mode is tasks-only.** A user request/action may only create/read/update what
the caller can reach **under their own RLS scope**. The trusted RLS bypass —
`SET LOCAL app.is_system_mode = true`, `_enter_system_mode`, the state machine's
`system_transition`, and `MediaService.resolve_urls_system` — is allowed **only** in the
worker/task layer (`app/platform/queue/**` and any `tasks.py`) and tests. It must **never**
appear in a request handler / action / domain query. CI enforces this two ways:
`semgrep/no-request-path-system-mode.yml` and `backend/scripts/check_conventions.py` both
fail (ERROR) on any of those four entry points outside the allowed locations. Need a
system-scoped write from a request? Enqueue a task — don't reach for the escape inline.

**Raw SQL & DB sessions are infra-only.** Raw statement execution (`.execute(text(...))`,
`.execute("...")`, `.exec_driver_sql(...)`) and DB engine/session creation
(`create_async_engine`, `async_sessionmaker`, `sessionmaker`) live **only** in the
reviewed infra/task layer (engine/session wiring in `app/config.py` · `app/factory.py` ·
`app/utils/deps.py` · `app/platform/queue/**`; raw SQL additionally in
`app/platform/base/rls_*.py` and any `tasks.py`). Domains use the injected `transaction`
dependency and build queries with `select()`/`insert()`/`update()`. CI enforces this via
`semgrep/no-raw-sql.yml` and `backend/scripts/check_conventions.py`.

---

## Routing & Auth Gate

`RootNavigator` (`navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`) reads `session` from `useSession()`, computes one of four statuses via `getAuthGateStatus()` (`lib/auth-session.ts`), and conditionally renders one of four top-level `<RootStack.Screen>`s — not file-based routing:

- No session → `Login`
- No `chosenName`, or no dating profile and role isn't `winger` → `Onboarding`
- Role = `winger` → `WingerTabs`
- Otherwise → `DaterTabs`

`Invite`, `MagicLink`, and `Settings` are always-mounted root-level screens alongside the gated ones. Cross-navigator jumps need React Navigation's nested-object `navigate()` syntax (e.g. `navigate('DaterTabs', { screen: 'Profile', params: { screen: 'WingpeopleList' } })`) — plain `navigate('ScreenName')` only bubbles up to an ancestor, never down into an unrelated sibling subtree.

Two `useEffect`s allowed in `RootNavigator`: the pending-intent handoff (winger-invite deep link / onboarding destination, both recorded before their target navigator is mounted) and push-token registration — both genuine external events.

---

## Auth Patterns

Auth is **self-hosted**. The backend exposes two `/auth/*` login methods:
**Apple Sign-In** verification and email **magic-link**. There is no phone/OTP path.

The session is a **server-side Redis session transported by an httpOnly cookie**
(Litestar `SessionAuth` + `ServerSideSessionConfig` + `RedisStore`, `samesite="lax"`) —
**not** a JWT or refresh token. Login (`/auth/apple`, `/auth/magic-link/verify`) sets the
session cookie via `Set-Cookie`; every subsequent request carries it. The only JWT in the
system is the *external* Apple identity token we verify in `clients/apple.py`.

On the client, `app/lib/auth-client.ts` is a thin cookie-bearing fetch
(`credentials: 'include'`) — no token storage, no `Authorization` header, no
refresh-on-401. It exposes `signInWithApple()`, `requestMagicLink(email)`,
`verifyMagicLink(token)`, `me()`, `restoreSession()`, `logout()`. The hook shapes are:

```ts
const { session, loading } = useSession(); // routing layer — session may be null
const { userId, session, signOut } = useAuth(); // authenticated screens — throws if no session
```

---

## Query Patterns

**Reads** go through Orval-generated `useGetApi*Suspense` hooks. `lib/api/http.ts`
returns the parsed body directly — no `{ data, status }` wrapper, no status checks at
callsites; it sends the session cookie (`credentials: 'include'`) and throws on a non-2xx.

**Writes** go through the typed action client `lib/api/actions.ts`, which hits
`POST /api/actions/{group}[/{object_id}]` with a tagged-union body
(`{ action, data }`) and returns `ActionExecutionResponse`
(`{ message, invalidate_queries, action_result, created_id }`). Wire with `useMutation`
+ `invalidateQueries`.

Realtime is the Litestar Channels websocket (`lib/ws-client.ts`, connects to
`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`'s `/ws` with its own `?token=`). Don't add ad-hoc client
selects — add a Litestar GET route (read) or an action (write).

---

## Codegen

The schema source of truth is **Alembic** (`backend/alembic/`); the API contract is
the **Litestar-emitted OpenAPI** (`app/openapi.json`), which Orval turns into typed
read hooks. The chain after a backend change:

```bash
# 1. schema: SQLAlchemy model → migration
just db-migrate "<message>"   # alembic revision --autogenerate
just db-upgrade               # alembic upgrade head (local)

# 2. contract: export the Litestar OpenAPI → app/openapi.json, then Orval
cd app && npm run api:gen     # orval ← app/openapi.json → app/lib/api/generated/
```

Run after: new/changed Litestar routes or schemas, and new actions. Idempotent.

**Hard constraints:**

- Schema writes go through **Alembic migrations only** — never hand-edit the DB.
- Generated artifacts (`app/openapi.json`, `app/lib/api/generated/`) belong in the same
  commit as the source change.

---

## Backend Architecture (Litestar)

`backend/` is a single Litestar app (`app/factory.py` builds it; `app/index.py` is the
ASGI entry). Runs as `api` + `worker` (SAQ) containers; co-located `postgres`/`redis`/`caddy`.

- **Auth.** Litestar `SessionAuth` reads the httpOnly session cookie, loads the session
  from Redis, and rehydrates the actor via `retrieve_user_handler`.
  `/auth/*` (Apple/magic-link) and `/ws` live at the root; everything else under `/api`.
- **Per-request DB + RLS.** Each request runs in a transaction on a connection opened as
  the **non-superuser `pear_app`** role, with `SET LOCAL app.user_id` (the actor). Because
  `pear_app` owns nothing, **FORCE RLS** is the genuine authorization floor — handler-side
  filters are for correctness/perf, not security. Trusted bootstrap/worker code uses the
  `public.is_system_mode()` escape (`SET LOCAL app.is_system_mode = true`), not a
  privileged connection.
- **Reads vs writes.** Reads are GET routes; **writes are registered actions** executed
  through `POST /api/actions/...`, gated by the per-domain state machine — never assign a
  status column directly.
- **Side effects** (push via direct **APNs**, email via **SES**, realtime broadcasts) fire
  from inside actions / queued SAQ tasks. No standalone functions.
- **Config & secrets.** `backend/app/config.py` reads env (`ENV`, `ASYNC_DATABASE_URL`
  vs `ADMIN_DB_URL`, `DB_APP_USER`/`DB_APP_PASSWORD`, `SECRET_KEY` (session signing),
  `SESSION_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`, `REDIS_URL`, `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`, `MAGIC_LINK_TTL_SECONDS`,
  `APNS_*`, `S3_*`, `SES_*`). In prod these come from Secrets Manager
  (merged into `/opt/pear/.env` by `deploy.sh`); local/testing select `Local*` clients
  (push/email/S3 no-op or log).

**Button** lives in `lib/forms/` — `import { Button } from '@/lib/forms'`. Variants: `default`, `outline`, `ghost`, `destructive`. Never hardcode a filled CTA manually.

## Styling (NativeWind v5 + Tailwind v4)

- **Always** import styled primitives from `@/lib/tw`: `View`, `Text`, `Pressable`, `ScrollView`, `TextInput`, `SafeAreaView`, `AnimatedView`.
- Never use `StyleSheet.create` — use `className`.
- `style` prop only for: `borderCurve`, dynamic/animated values, SVG props.
- Never use function-style `style` on `Pressable` (NativeWind bug #1105 — children don't render). Use `active:` pseudo-class.
- `cn()` from `@/lib/cn` for conditional classes.
- Design tokens in `global.css` under `@theme` — never add raw hex to `constants/theme.ts`.

**Modal color caveat:** CSS variables aren't injected in Modal's native layer. Use `ModalView` from `@/lib/tw` with a `backgroundColor` style prop (not className) for colors inside Modals.

### Design Tokens

**Surfaces:** `bg-background` (#F5F1E8) · `bg-surface` (#FBF8F1) · `bg-surface-muted` (#EDE6D6)

**Text:** `text-foreground`/`text-fg` · `text-foreground-muted`/`text-fg-muted` · `text-foreground-subtle`/`text-fg-subtle`

**Brand:** `text-primary`/`bg-primary` (leaf green) · `text-primary-soft`/`bg-primary-soft`

**Accent:** `text-accent`/`bg-accent` · `bg-accent-muted`

**Borders:** `border-border` · `border-border-subtle`

**Status:** `text-destructive` · `text-green` (presence)

**Fonts:** `font-serif` (DMSerifDisplay, display headers) · `font-sans` (Geist, body)

**Sizes:** `text-11` through `text-30` · **Radii:** `radius-4/9/13/14/16/18/21/22/26`

**Escape hatch** (icon `color=`, animated values): `import { colors } from '@/constants/theme'` — `colors.primary` `colors.primarySoft` `colors.ink` `colors.inkMid` `colors.inkDim` `colors.divider` `colors.green` `colors.white`.

## Coding Preferences

- **Composition:** Orchestrators decide what to render; logic lives close to where it's used.
- **Control flow:** `switch` on discriminated unions. Explicit `return` on every branch.
- **No `useEffect`:** Move async work into transition handlers. Exceptions: the auth-provider mount effect (restore session on launch + handle the magic-link deep link), push token registration, AsyncStorage deep-link check (mount-only, genuine external events).
- **Error propagation:** No try/catch across callback boundaries. Return errors as values. User-facing errors via `toast.error()`.
- **Forms:** react-hook-form everywhere — `Controller`, `handleSubmit`, `isSubmitting`, `isValid`, `mode: 'onChange'`.
- **Queries:** Transforms belong in the query function. Unwrapping boilerplate belongs in the query wrapper, not callsites. No magic string cache keys.
- `async/await` over `.then()`.

## Development Workflows

The repo is a monorepo. All app commands run from `app/` — either via the root `Justfile`
(`just --list` to see recipes) or directly with `cd app && npm run …`.

All recipes are in the root `Justfile` (`just --list`). The common ones:

```bash
# Everything at once (backend api + worker + Expo sim)
just dev

# Backend (Litestar, Python/uv — from repo root)
just db-start         # local postgres + redis (docker compose)
just db-upgrade       # alembic upgrade head
just db-migrate "msg" # alembic autogenerate a new revision
just dev-backend      # litestar api, hot-reload, :8000
just dev-worker       # SAQ worker
just test             # pytest
just lint-backend     # ruff check --fix + format
just check-backend    # basedpyright

# App (Expo — these cd into app/)
cd app && npm run dev:sim        # iOS Simulator
cd app && npm run web            # Expo web
cd app && npm run api:gen        # Orval ← app/openapi.json (after a backend contract change)
cd app && npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint

# Build & deploy the app (Xcode Cloud + self-hosted OTA — separate from the backend pipeline)
cd app && npm run export:ota     # expo export -p ios — JS bundle for the OTA publish job (ota.yml)
cd app && npm run build:device   # opens ios/Pear.xcworkspace in Xcode — pick your device, hit Run
                                  # (requires an `xcodegen generate && pod install` first if the
                                  # workspace hasn't been generated yet, e.g. via `npm run dev:sim`;
                                  # cloud-managed signing means no local certs/profiles to script —
                                  # this builds the same project Xcode Cloud builds from)
# Native archive/sign/submit (TestFlight/App Store) runs in Xcode Cloud, triggered on `v*` tags —
# no local EAS build/submit step.
```

**Env.** `backend/.env.local` (or repo-root `.env.local`) carries the backend secrets
(`DB_*`, `SECRET_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`, `APPLE_*`, `APNS_*`, `S3_*`, `SES_*`); local dev falls back
to safe defaults (port 5432, `Local*` clients). The app needs
`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.<domain>` (or `http://localhost:8000` locally) — it is
the only backend coordinate the client needs.

**Terraform (`infra/`).** All infra changes are committed to the repo and applied via
CI/CD (`.github/workflows/build-test-deploy.yml` / the infra workflow) — never run
`terraform apply` (or `import`/`destroy`) against the real backend from a local machine
or an agent session, even with valid AWS credentials on hand. `terraform plan` is fine
for review. Land the `.tf` changes in a PR and let the pipeline apply them.

## Image Handling

- `react-native-image-crop-picker` — select from camera roll (`lib/photos.ts`'s `pickAndResizePhoto`)
- `@bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer` — resize to max 1200px width, JPEG compress
- RN core `<Image>` + hand-rolled `components/ui/CrossfadeImage.tsx` — display, with the
  expo-image `transition` crossfade reimplemented as two stacked `Image`s + `Animated.timing`

---

## Build Configuration

- **Bundle ID:** `com.plabrum.pear`
- **Version source:** `package.json` for the JS side; `MARKETING_VERSION`/`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`
  in `app/ios/project.yml` for `CFBundleShortVersionString`/`CFBundleVersion` (bump both on
  release — the generated `Info.plist` only ever reflects `project.yml`, never edit it directly).
  **Runtime version:** fingerprint · **New Architecture:** enabled
- No EAS — native build/sign/submit is Xcode Cloud (triggered on `v*` tags), building the
  `app/ios/` project (XcodeGen-generated from the committed `project.yml`) directly. No
  `eas.json`, no EAS profiles.

---

## TypeScript

- Strict mode. Path alias `@/*` → `./` (relative to `app/`).
- The typed API surface is the Orval-generated `app/lib/api/generated/` (reads) +
  `app/lib/api/actions.ts` (writes), both derived from `app/openapi.json`. Treat generated
  files as build output — never hand-edit; regenerate via `npm run api:gen`.
